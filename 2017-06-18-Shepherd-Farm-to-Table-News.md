# Shepherd Farm to Table tickets available for purchase

SHEPHERD COMMUNITY FARM TO TABLE DINNER

TICKETS ARE NOW ON SALE AT THESE SHEPHERD BUSINESSES:

* Mitchell's Gourmet Deli & Market

* Marrita's

* Shepherd Bar & Restaurant

The cost is $25 per person, and dress is casual.

We will eat in the middle of Second Street near the Post Office.

## Entertainment

Local trio Tinkers Folly will begin playing at 6:00 p.m. to welcome guests as they chat and find their ways to their seats. Dinner will be served at 6:30 and will be prepared by local chefs using locally sourced veggies, meats and fruits as appetizers, entrees and desserts. This will be a meal with a definite panache!

## Schedule

Guests are encouraged to arrive at 6:00 to have time to look over and bid on the terrific, wide-ranging assortment of Silent Auction items. There will be door-prize drawings, too, and significant toe tapping.

What if it rains? St. Vincent De Paul Catholic Church has graciously offered their parish hall to keep us, the band and the delectable meals dry.

## General Information

All proceeds from the dinner (after the bills are paid) will be donated to the St. Vincent De Paul Food Pantry in Shepherd.
